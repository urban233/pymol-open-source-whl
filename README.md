This repository offers **unofficial** binary wheels for the open-source version of PyMOL(TM)
for **all major** operating systems.
These wheel files are intended for use in a Python project.
If you are searching for PyMOL as ready-to-use application go to 
this repository: [pymol-open-source-setup](https://github.com/kullik01/pymol-open-source-setup).

## About PyMOL
[PyMOL™](https://pymol.org/) is a powerful visualization software for rendering and animating 3D molecular structures. PyMOL is a trademark of Schrödinger, LLC.

Please note that the files provided here are **unofficial**. They are informal, unrecognized, and unsupported, offered for testing and evaluation purposes only. No warranty or liability is provided, and the software is made available "as-is."

## Contents of this repository
### Scripts
There is one Python script that is used for building PyMOL specific shader files.

### Pre-built
To enable the direct build of a ready-to-use wheel file, a pre-built
`_cmd` module is already compiled and will be used in the wheel build process
if no self built one can be found.
Furthermore, the libGL library is also provided to make the build process
easier and less error-prone.

### Vcpkg
To make the build process of the `_cmd` module as easy and convenient as
possible, the vcpkg package manager is used. The package manager should
handle all build dependencies PyMOL needs.

## Install
To install PyMOL run:
```shell
pip install pymol-open-source-whl
```

## Build wheel file
To build the wheel file (based on the provided pre-built `_cmd` module), follow these steps (the working directory is the repository root directory):

1. Set up a Python virtual environment under the project root directory.

2. Install all requirements using the requirements.txt:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the build environment by running:
   ```shell
   ./win_automator.bat setup dev-env
   ```

4. Build the wheel file using the pre-built `_cmd` module
    ```shell
    python -m build
    ```
   After a successful build the wheel file can be found under the `dist/` folder.

## From source
The following information is about building only the `_cmd` module from source.

### Prerequisites
- CMake
    - **Be aware**: Add the cmake to your PATH variable. Check by running `cmake --version`
- Clang & Clang++:
    - Xcode developer tools

### Step-by-step guide
1. Load the CMake project (e.g. in PyCharm right-click on the CMakeLists.txt file
   and select `Load CMake Project`)
2. Create a `Release` CMake build profile (e.g. in PyCharm click on the CMake
   icon in the bottom left panel and click on the `Gear icon > CMake Settings`)
3. Add the following line to your CMake build profile:
    ```shell
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$CMakeProjectDir$/vendor/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
    ```
4. Build the project.

## Acknowledgements
**Schrödinger** for being the driving force behind the continued development of PyMOL after Warren's passing, ensuring that the open-source version remained alive and well.

**NOTE**: the following list has not been updated since Fall 2003.  
Since then, the PyMOL effort has grown to such an extent that it is no longer
practical to recognize everyone individually.  Fortunately, a public
record of participation exists and can be appreciated on the internet,
and especially via the PyMOL mailing list archives.  Suffice it to say
that the PyMOL user community now numbers well into the thousands and
includes scientists, students, and educators worldwide, spread
throughout academia and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries.  Though DeLano Scientific LLC specifically supports and
maintains the PyMOL code base, the project can only continue to
succeed through the sponsorship and participation of the broader
community.

Minor Authors (500+ lines of code):

their way to help the project with their ideas, actions,
advice, hardware donations, testing, information, sponsorship,
peer support, or code snippets.
